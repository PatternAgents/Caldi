PatternAgents Caldi I2C PyroInfraRed Grid Sensor is a small PIR sensor board that utilizes
the Panasonic "GridEye" sensor to give an 8x8 PIR matix heat view of a room.
THis can used to determine the number of people in the room and relative heat signatures.

Licensing GPLv3 ( http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html )

PatternAgents uses the increasingly popular business model called "Dual Licensing" 
in which both the open source software distribution mechanism and traditional commercial software distribution models are combined.

Open Source Projects:        

If you are developing and distributing open source applications under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3), 
as published by the Free Software Foundation, then you are free to use the PatternAgents hardware/software under the GPLv3 license. 
Please note that GPLv3 Section 3(b) requires that all modifications to the original code as well as all Derivative Works 
must also be released under the terms of the GPLv3 open source license.

Closed Source Projects:

If you are developing and distributing traditional closed source or commercial applications, 
you must purchase a PatternAgents commercial use license, 
which is specifically designed for users interested in retaining the proprietary status of their designs and code. 
All PatternAgents commercial licenses expressly supersede the GPLv3 open source license. 
This means that when you license the PatternAgents software under a commercial license, 
you specifically do not use the software under the open source license and therefore you are not subject to any of its terms.
